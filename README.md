# NEOCULI
NEOCULI - 2021
Our project proposes a way to link people with total visual blindness or
partial, with the world around them. Neoculi will allow the
user to recognize the objects that, for example, he uses at the
time to move through the streets, such as: signs of
traffic, traffic lights, vehicles, pedestrian paths; the
things you use on a day-to-day basis; people; animals; between
others. This would allow for greater interaction between the
individuals with this visual difficulty, with the environment that
surrounds.
The biggest advantage of Neoculi is its low cost of
manufacturing that could allow access to this technology to a greater number of
people who require it.
Neoculi consists of a device that connects to lenses through which a camera
records what the user is aiming with their head. When the “object” is detected by the lenses,
a voice can be heard through the earpiece found in these.
